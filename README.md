# Getting Started with React Ai-Chat demo project

### `Choice`

If you want to try the chat in action without using the server, go to the "api" folder. Next is the "postOpenAi.js" file. And comment the "//With server" code and uncomment the "//Without server" code. ""//Without server"" will respond randomly by giving response and reject.

### `Important`

Before you start testing the project you should do two steps listed below.

- #### Step 1:

  Create OpenAI account and create your private OpenAI "key" and provide "Organization ID".\
  Link to `key`: [platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) \
  Link to `Organization ID`: [platform.openai.com/account/org-settings](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)\

- #### Step 2:
  Create `.env` file in project folder and indicate in the file two lines of code indicated below\
  `API_KEY=key`\
  `ORG=Organization ID`

### `npm start`
